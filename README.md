#GameIdea
* Builds the game in your surrounds using either your phone camera or your webcam
* Cockroaches and astroids are built randomly in the game.
* Using a green object you can "squash" the cockroaches. Although, sqaushing an asteroid will lose you a life.
* Game's main goal is to provide fun regardless of where you and in your environment.
* Enjoy :)

#Disclaimer

* The game was built to recognize the color green particularly well, although, it can recognize other closly related colors.
* Try to use a white background while playing, and use 1920x1080 to avoid problems with detection on the sides.
